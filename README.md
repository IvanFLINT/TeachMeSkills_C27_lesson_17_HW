<h4>Task1:</h4> The program creates a generalized functional interface.
- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with a string type and pass the line reversal logic (outputting the line in reverse order) to the interface method.

- if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with an integer type and pass the logic for finding the factorial of a number to the interface method.
<ul>
  <li>In the Runner class, the mine method takes a value into the Scanner class and calls the service method.</li>
  <li>The PassportID interface contains constants. Passport numbers.</li>
  <li>In the Service class, the service method takes a value from the Scanner class and, using the if conditional operator, performs two functions. The first one reverses the string, the second one calculates the factorial.</li>
  <li>The functional interface contains the doSomething method.</li>
</ul>
h4>Task2:</h4> The program displays the day of the week by date to the console.
<ul>
  <li>In the Runner class, the mine method calls the whatDay method to display the current day of the week.</li>
  <li>In the DayOfTheWeek class, the whatDay method uses the SimpleDateFormat class to format the date.</li>
</ul>
